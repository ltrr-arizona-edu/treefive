Background
----------

This Drupal sub-theme augments the popular Omega theme with details relevant to the LTRR web site. It is not intended to work s a generally applicable theme, just serve the limited needs of that one project. It was developed for the older version of Omega (currently 7.x-3.1), not more recent developments such as Omega 4.x.

Documentation
-------------

The sub-theme depends on Omega (obviously), and in practice was being used with the Omega Tools (7.x-3.0-rc4), Delta (7.x-3.0-beta11), and Context (7.x-3.0-beta7) modules. The documentation for the older versions of Omega is at
https://drupal.org/node/1768696

All the usual caveats about modifying the base theme apply: this is supposed to go into a sub-directory of the directory holding the other themes, at the same level as the Omega base theme.
